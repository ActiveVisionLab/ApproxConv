# ApproxConv: Approximating Continuous Convolutions for Deep Network Compression

This is the official code repository for the BMVC 2022 paper: ["Approximating Continuous Convolutions for Deep Network Compression"](https://approxconv.active.vision)

## Requirements
Whilst an environment file is provided for use with ana/miniconda the core dependencies are:

    - Python 3.8
    - PyTorch 1.8.0
    - PyTorch Lightning 1.5.3
    - OmegaConf

You will also need to initialise the quantization submodule to run the quantisation experiments.
